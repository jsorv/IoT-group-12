# Smart Intrusion Detection & Access Control System

This project is an Intrusion Detection & Access Control System designed for the IoT course at the University of Oulu. The system utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico W to detect unauthorized motion, triggering both local and remote alarms. It integrates a custom Android mobile application for real-time monitoring and remote control of a physical locking mechanism. The solution leverages the MQTT protocol for low-latency communication and cloud-based data logging for historical analysis, with Hive used for HTTPS display.
